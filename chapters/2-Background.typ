== Kotlin

// TODO: scriverlo per davvero

Kotlin @Kotlin is a statically-typed, versatile programming language that was developed by JetBrains in 2011. Built with the aim to enhance productivity and satisfaction of developers, it offers a unique blend of object-oriented and functional programming features capable of gracing any application with simplicity, clarity, and excellent interoperability. Kotlin is primarily used for Android app development and is officially recommended by Google. Its efficiency, conciseness, and safety to prevent common programming errors make it a rather compelling choice for developers worldwide.

Only Kotlin's features that are relevant for this work will be discussed in detail.

=== Mutable and immutable variables

// AIG
// sistema i blocchi di codice che vanno a capo

In Kotlin, mutability refers to the capability to alter the value of a variable after it has been initialized. Variables in Kotlin are either mutable, defined using the `var` keyword, or immutable, defined using the `val` keyword. Mutable variables, once assigned, can have their value changed during the execution of the program, while immutable variables, once assigned a value, cannot be altered subsequently. For instance, `var x = 5` allows you to change the value of x later in the program, while `val y = 5` maintains y at a value of 5 throughout the program. Mutability is a fundamental principle in programming, and Kotlin's clear distinction between `val` and `var` enhances code readability and aids in maintaining data consistency, especially in a multithreaded environment.

=== Smart Casts

// AIG un po' rivisto

In Kotlin, smart casts refer to a feature of the language that automatically handles explicit typecasting, reducing the need for manual intervention. A smart cast occurs when the compiler tracks conditions inside conditional expressions and automatically casts types if possible, eliminating the necessity for explicit casting in many scenarios. This considerably simplifies the syntax and increases readability. For example, if we perform a type check on a variable in an `if` condition, we can use that variable in its checked type within the `if` block without the requirement to explicitly cast it. An example of smart cast can be found in @smart-cast

  ```kt
  open class A()
  class B : A() {
      fun f() = println("B")
  }

  fun callIfIsB(a: A) {
      if (a is B) {
          a.f()
  //      ^^^^^
  //  Smart cast to B 
      }
  }
  ```
)<smart-cast>


=== Null Safety

=== Contracts

Kotlin contracts are an experimental feature introduced in Kotlin 1.3 designed to provide additional guarantees about code behavior, helping the compiler in performing more precise analysis and optimizations. Contracts are defined using a special contract block within a function, describing the relationship between input parameters and the function's effects. This can include conditions such as whether a lambda is invoked or if a function returns under certain conditions. By specifying these relationships, contracts help the compiler understand the function's logic more deeply, enabling advanced features like smart casting and better null-safety checks.

It is important to point out that currently contracts correctness is not statically verified. The compiler trusts contracts unconditionally meaning that the programmer is responsible for writing correct and sound contracts.

In @contract-1 it is possible to see how contracts allow the initialization of immutable variables within the body of a lambda, doing this is not possible without using a contract (@contract-2).

          callsInPlace(block, InvocationKind.EXACTLY_ONCE)
      }
      return block()
  }

  fun main() {
    val b: Boolean
    run {
        b = true
    }
    println(b)
  }
  ```
)<contract-1>

  ```kt
  fun <R> runWithoutContract(block: () -> R): R {
      return block()
  }

  fun main() {
      val b: Boolean
      runWithoutContract { b = true }
  /*                       ^^^^^^^^
      Captured values initialization is forbidden 
      due to possible reassignment

  }  
  ```

== Aliasing

// TODO: Read better these summaries and modify them (AIG)

// TODO: cite book aliasing

Aliasing refers to the situation where a data location in memory can be accessed through different symbolic names in the program. Thus, changing the data through one name inherently leads to a change when accessed through the other name as well. This can happen due to several reasons such as pointers, references, multiple arrays pointing to the same memory location etc.

In contrast, uniqueness ensures that a particular data location is accessed through only one symbolic name at any point in time. This means that no two variables or references point to the same memory location, thus preventing unintended side effects when data is modified. Uniqueness is particularly important in concurrent programming and in functional programming paradigms, where the goal is often to avoid mutable shared state to ensure predictability and maintainability of the code. By enforcing uniqueness, programmers can guarantee that data modifications are localized and do not inadvertently affect other parts of the program, making reasoning about program behavior and correctness more straightforward.

@aliasing shows the concept of aliasing and uniqueness practically with a Kotlin example.
The function starts by declaring and initializing variable `y` with `x`, resulting in `x` and `y` being aliased.
Following that, variable `z` is initialized with a newly-created object in the function's second line. Therefore, at this stage in the program, `z` can be referred to as "unique", signifying that it is the only reference pointing to that particular object.

#figure(
  caption: "Aliasing, an example",
  ```kt
  class T()

  fun f(x: T) {
      val y = x // 'x' and 'y' are now aliased
      val z = T() // here 'z' is unique
  }
  ```

=== Problems caused by aliasing

Aliasing is a topic that has been studied for decades in Computer Science. 
Although aliasing is essential in object-oriented programming as it allows programmers to implement designs involving sharing, as described in The Geneva Convention @GenevaConvention, aliasing can be a problem in both formal veriÔ¨Åcation and practical programming.

The example in @alias-verification illustrates how aliasing between references can complicate the formal verification process. In the given example, a class `A` is declared with a boolean field `x`, followed by the function `f` which accepts two arguments `a1` and `a2` of type `A`. The function assigns `true` to `a1.x`, `false` to `a2.x`, and finally returns `a1.x`. Despite the function being straightforward, we cannot assert that the function will always return `true`. The reason for this uncertainty is the potential aliasing of `a1` and `a2`, as the second assignment might change the value of `a1.x` as well.

Modern programming languages frequently utilize a high degree of concurrency, which can further complicate the verification process. As showed in @alias-verification-concurrent, even a simpler function than its counterpart in @alias-verification does not permit to assert that it will always return `true`. In this instance, the function only takes a single argument `a` of type `A`, assigns `true` to `a.x` and eventually retruns it. However, within a concurrent context there may exist another thread with access to a variable aliasing `a` that can modify `a.x` to `false` prior to the function's return, thus challenging the verification process.

Finally, @alias-bug presents a contrived example to illustrate how aliasing can lead to mysterious bugs. Function `f` takes two lists `xs` and `ys` as arguments.If both lists are not empty, the function removes the last element from each. One might assume this function will never raise an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. However, if `xs` and `ys` are aliased and have a size of one, this exception will occur.

=== How to deal with aliasing

The Geneva Convention @GenevaConvention has established four primary methods to manage aliasing: Detection, Advertisement, Prevention, and Control. These methods aim to provide systematic approaches to identify, communicate, prevent, and manage aliasing in software systems.

==== Detection
Alias detection is a retrospective process that identifies potential or actual alias patterns in a program through static or dynamic techniques. This is beneficial for compilers, static analysis tools, and programmers as they can detect aliasing conflicts in programs, leads to more efficient code generation, helps find cases where aliasing can invalidate predicates, and assists programmers in resolving problematic conflicts. 

Alias detection needs a complex interprocedural analysis due to its non-local nature. It provides information about the alias relationship between two variables i.e. if they never, sometimes, or always alias the same object. Variables are said to sometimes alias, when they are aliased in some situations but not always. This information is particularly useful for optimization purposes.

==== Advertisement
Because global alias detection is impractical, it is crucial to develop methods and constructs for modular analysis. Programmers and formalists benefit from constructs that enhance local analysis by annotating methods based on their aliasing properties. Optimistic assumptions about aliasing are common, such as expecting a Boolean object's or(arg) method to return a new object rather than an aliased one, despite it being correct behavior.

Popular object-oriented languages lack means to indicate whether methods capture objects by creating persistent access paths. Annotations indicating which object bindings are captured by a method and which aliases a method can handle could function similarly to const in C++, offering useful behavioral specifications.

For instance, qualifying a parameter with uncaptured would indicate that the object is not bound to a variable that could be modified through side channels after the method returns. A method like or might declare that both self and arg are const and uncaptured, and the return variable is also uncaptured.

Methods could also be advertised with preconditions like noalias, indicating that actual arguments should not be aliased, a restriction common in Turing. The pattern of const, noalias, and uncaptured operands and results mirrors "pure" functions, enhancing reasoning about program behavior. Enforcing such qualifiers leads to effective alias prevention.

==== Prevention

Alias prevention techniques introduce constructs that ensure aliasing does not occur in specific contexts, enabling static checkability by compilers and program analyzers. However, this requires conservative definitions, which may restrict valid uses that are not syntactically safe. For instance, checkable constructs like "uncaptured" and "noalias" may overly limit variable bindings and changes within collections, respectively.

Conservatism ensures validity but may prevent valid formulas from being provable and safe code from compiling without errors. Therefore, fine-grained alias prevention constructs have limited utility, necessitating higher-level constructs.

One such higher-level construct is "islands," which isolate groups of related objects, preventing static references across their boundaries. This allows scalable aliasing control within these isolated groups.

A more radical approach replaces the traditional assignment operator with a swapping operator, eliminating reference copying and thus avoiding aliasing issues. However, this requires a different programming paradigm, which may not integrate well with mainstream object-oriented techniques.


==== Control

Aliasing prevention alone is insufficient because aliasing is unavoidable in conventional object-oriented programming. Aliasing control is necessary to ensure the system does not reach a state with unexpected aliasing, which requires analysis of the runtime state.

== Viper and Separation Logic

=== Separation Logic
In Computer Science, separation logic @1029817 is an extension of Hoare logic, a way of reasoning about programs.

Separation logic facilitates reasoning about:
- Programs that manipulate pointer data structures including information hiding in the presence of pointers.
- Managing "transfer of ownership" principles.
- Virtual separation (modular reasoning) between concurrent modules.

$
angle.l "assert" angle.r &::= \
&| "emp" &&& "empty heap" \
&| angle.l "exp" angle.r |-> angle.l "exp" angle.r &&& "singleton heap" \
&| angle.l "assert" angle.r * angle.l "assert" angle.r &&& "separating conjunction" \
&| angle.l "assert" angle.r "‚àí‚àó" angle.l "assert" angle.r #h(5em) &&& "separating implication" \
$

=== Viper

// TODO: use different words (this is just copy pasted)

Viper @MuellerSchwerhoffSummers16 (Verification Infrastructure for Permission-based Reasoning) is a language and suite of tools, providing an architecture on which new verification tools and prototypes can be developed simply and quickly. Viper is being developed at ETH Zurich in close collaboration with the team of Alex Summers at UBC.

Viper comprises a novel intermediate verification language, also named Viper, and automatic verifiers for the language, as well as example front-end tools. The Viper toolset can be used to implement verification techniques for front-end programming languages via translations into the Viper language.

The Viper toolchain is designed to make it easy to implement verification techniques for sequential and concurrent programs with mutable state. It provides native support for reasoning about the program state using permissions or ownership, e.g. in the style of separation logic. New verification techniques can be implemented directly as translations to the Viper language, using either of the verifiers provided. The Viper language is also useful to encode verification problems manually, for instance, while prototyping new verification techniques.
