// TODO: scriverlo per davvero XD
// meglio concentrarsi su caratteristiche del linguaggio (OO, concurrency, jvm, ...)

Kotlin is a statically-typed, versatile programming language that was developed by JetBrains in 2011. Built with the aim to enhance productivity and satisfaction of developers, it offers a unique blend of object-oriented and functional programming features capable of gracing any application with simplicity, clarity, and excellent interoperability. Kotlin is primarily used for Android app development and is officially recommended by Google. Its efficiency, conciseness, and safety to prevent common programming errors make it a rather compelling choice for developers worldwide.

// === Object oriented

// === Null Safety

// === Smart useCaseDetails

// === Contracts

== Why controlling aliasing can improve the language

=== Verify  contracts
=== Static analysis (IntelliJ)
=== Smart cast
=== Function optimiztion (modify lists implace)
=== Garbage collection in Kotlin native
