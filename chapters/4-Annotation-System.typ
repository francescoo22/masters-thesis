== Aliasing control in Kotlin

=== Verify  contracts
// TODO (AIG)
Kotlin contracts are a feature introduced in Kotlin 1.3 designed to provide additional guarantees about code behavior, aiding the compiler in performing more precise analysis and optimizations. Contracts are defined using a special contract block within a function, describing the relationship between input parameters and the function's effects. This can include conditions such as whether a lambda is invoked or if a function returns under certain conditions. By specifying these relationships, contracts help the compiler understand the function's logic more deeply, enabling advanced features like smart casting and better null-safety checks. Essentially, contracts serve as a tool to make code safer and more predictable, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.
